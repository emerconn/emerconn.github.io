In this blog, I teach topics relating to Cybersecurity, SysOps, & DevOps.

**About Me**  
I am currently studying for an AS in Cybersecurity at [Madison College](https://madisoncollege.edu/academics/programs/cybersecurity-specialist#overview), in addition to working as a Systems Engineer & Administrator for [Lakeshore Recycling Sytems](https://www.lrsrecycles.com/about/).

I enjoy engaging in rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/emerconghaile/learning), for both professional and hobby endavors.
